Welcome to the Concurrent File Server!
======================================

This is a sample text file to demonstrate the file transfer system.

Features:
---------
✓ Multi-threaded server architecture
✓ Concurrent client handling
✓ Connection-oriented TCP sockets
✓ 1000 bytes per flush operation
✓ 200ms sleep between transfers
✓ Interactive web interface

The server spawns a new thread for each client connection,
allowing multiple clients to download files simultaneously
without blocking each other.

Each thread is responsible for:
1. Receiving the filename from the client
2. Opening and reading the requested file
3. Transferring the file in 1000-byte chunks
4. Sleeping for 200ms between each chunk
5. Closing the connection when complete

This approach ensures efficient resource utilization and
responsive service for all connected clients.

Thank you for using the Concurrent File Server!
